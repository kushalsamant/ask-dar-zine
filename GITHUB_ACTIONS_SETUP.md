4. The workflow will automatically appear under "Workflows"

## ‚è∞ Step 3: Customize Schedule (Optional)

To change the schedule, edit `.github/workflows/daily-zine-generation.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Current: Daily at 4:00 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 4 * * *'
    
    # Other options:
    # - cron: '0 6 * * *'     # 6:00 AM UTC
    # - cron: '0 12 * * *'    # 12:00 PM UTC
    # - cron: '0 4 * * 1-5'   # Weekdays only at 4:00 AM
    # - cron: '0 */6 * * *'   # Every 6 hours
```

## üéØ Step 4: Test the Workflow

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on "Daily Zine Generation"
3. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
4. Monitor the execution

## üìä Step 5: Monitor Results

### **Generated Content:**
- **Images:** Stored in `images/` folder by style
- **Captions:** Stored in `captions/` folder by style
- **Weekly PDFs:** Stored in `weekly_curated/` folder
- **Monthly PDFs:** Stored in `monthly_curated/` folder
- **Logs:** Available in Actions run logs
- **Artifacts:** Downloadable from Actions tab

### **Repository Updates:**
- All generated content is automatically committed
- Each run creates a new commit with timestamp
- Images are preserved with timestamps to prevent overwrites

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **API Key Errors:**
   - Check all API keys are correctly set in secrets
   - Verify API keys have sufficient credits

2. **Permission Errors:**
   - Ensure repository has Actions enabled
   - Check workflow has write permissions

3. **Schedule Not Running:**
   - GitHub Actions may have delays
   - Check Actions tab for any failed runs
   - Verify cron syntax is correct

### **Manual Trigger:**
You can always run the workflow manually:
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Daily Zine Generation
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select branch and run

## üìà Benefits of GitHub Actions

‚úÖ **Automatic Backups:** All content committed to repo  
‚úÖ **Version Control:** Track changes over time  
‚úÖ **Artifact Storage:** Download generated content  
‚úÖ **Cost Effective:** Free for public repos  
‚úÖ **Reliable:** GitHub's infrastructure  
‚úÖ **Notifications:** Email/webhook notifications  

## üé® Content Strategy

With the automated system, you'll have:
