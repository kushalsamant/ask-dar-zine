The project was inspired by the name \"Gwangyang\" itself—'Gwang' meaning light and 'Yang' sunlight—which became a guiding principle in shaping the form and spirit of the space. The resulting architecture captures the flowing rhythm of light through its curved steel surfaces, creating a sculptural yet purposeful structure that embodies both technological and cultural narratives.</p>",

We are constantly bombarded with data confirming the prevalence of urban life, but we rarely ask the opposite question: what did those who moved to the cities leave behind? What remains alive and evolving far from urban centers?The countryside—long underestimated—is now emerging as fertile ground for possibility. More than a “marginalized space,” rural Latin America today asserts itself as a true laboratory for architectural, social, and ecological experimentation. From agroecological communities to low-impact technologies, from relationships between humans, machines, and other living beings to locally grounded solutions for global challenges—such as the climate crisis, food security, and migration—the rural world is actively and inventively reshaping its own future.+ 9 Although home to half the world’s population, rural areas have been sidelined by dominant urban narratives, often reduced to “terra incognita”—much like 18th-century maps where vast regions of the globe appeared as empty, mysterious, unexplored spaces. For decades, little was said about what happens outside the cities. But today, while urban centers consolidate their infrastructure, the countryside is undergoing profound and surprising transformations. Far from being static or outdated, the contemporary rural landscape has become a dynamic arena of change: biotechnology, seasonal migration, government subsidies, flexible agriculture, and digital monitoring all coexist in this territory in flux. It is hard to imagine an urban setting as radically diverse as this.

The farmer—now more of a data analyst than a field worker—operates everything from a computer-equipped room, processing digital information that results in millions of liters of milk each year. The tractor, once a symbol of the 19th-century agricultural revolution, has become a sophisticated digital workstation. Equipped with sensors and algorithms, it connects the operator directly to the soil, maximizing land productivity. Rural labor has become a digital practice, and the countryside—vast and multifaceted—is now also a virtual landscape.This wave of innovation has also reached the field of architecture, giving rise to strategies deeply rooted in loca...",

Conceived between 2005 and 2006, it is one of the late architect's final projects in the country. The design features a domed structure approximately 60 meters in diameter, suspended by two towering elements rising 100 meters high.

Earlier this year, photographer Paul Clemence visited the site, documenting the building process and capturing the emergence of Niemeyer's signature curves.+ 23 Save this picture!© Paul ClemenceThe history of the project dates back to 1921, when the first metropolitan archbishop of Belo Horizonte arrived to establish the newly created diocese. The initial architectural proposal, inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, followed the vision laid out by urban planner Aarão Reis when designing Belo Horizonte. However, the original plan for the Cristo Rei Cathedral was never completed and was postponed until 2004. That year, the city's fourth archbishop commissioned a new, contemporary design from modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer. The new project was intended to address the evolving role of a cathedral in the 21st century, as a space for spirituality, culture, education, art, and social care, as well as for reflection and dialogue. Niemeyer was selected for his celebrated work on the Pampulha complex, whose modernist landmarks are already integral to the identity of the region.Save this picture!© Paul ClemenceSave this picture!© Paul ClemenceAccordingly, both the location and architectural approach to the Cristo Rei Cathedral were redefined. A new site was chosen to mark the geographic and symbolic center of Minas Gerais' urban fabric, at once the heart of the Archdiocese and the periphery of Belo Horizonte. Niemeyer's design envisions an open plaza intended not only for religious ceremonies and prayer but also for social support services, educational and cultural programs, the preservation of sacred art, and evangelization through media. According to Clemence, the area is a bustling zone near a highway, offering a unique richness visible from above the cathedral's dome. The initiative for this new cathedral began in 2004, followed by a meeting between the archbishop and Niemeyer in 2005. The design was completed in 2006, publicly presen...",

The project transforms a traditional Spanish finca into a countryside retreat, infusing the surrounding nine-acre olive grove with Ibiza’s bohemian spirit. This latest Soho House project is led by interior designer Sophie Baker, who worked with the existing architecture rather than against it. ‘The building originated as a family home, and there’s a real warmth to it from the moment you walk in,’ Sophie Baker says. ‘Given the building’s inherent charm, our aim was to avoid altering its foundation much at all.’ Terracotta floors, timber beams, and thick whitewashed walls remain largely untouched, forming a tactile base for a design approach that favors continuity over contrast.images © Edvinas Bruzas and Safia Shakarchi  a design-minded renovation Grounded in Place With the renovation, the Soho House design team references the agricultural typology of a working farmhouse typical of Ibiza. The white exterior facades, low rooflines, and masonry walls anchor the structure within its setting. Spread across approximately 2,246 square meters (24,000 square feet), the retreat includes a central house, a three-bedroom annex, two villas, and an assortment of shared spaces: a club, bar, restaurant, library, boutique, and wellness center. Inside, the interiors respond to Ibiza’s natural palette. ‘We selected the colors, materials and textures carefully,’ designer Sophie Baker continues. ‘We kept a serene, rustic farmhouse aesthetic — lots of wood and organic textures in the furniture, curated antiques, and delicate lighting.’ Elements such as 1970s glassware, plaster lamps from local artisans, and patterned silk rugs echo the island’s history without veering into pastiche. A combination of rattan headboards, four-poster linen beds, and leather-upholstered furnishings reinforces a tactile, textural sensibility throughout.the art collection focuses on artists living in or connected to the Balearic Islands  spaces for rest and ritual Bedrooms reflect a restrained design language with gestures toward local craftsmanship and seasonal living. ‘For the colour palette of the bedrooms, we reflected the natural surroundings with hints of orange and green – they make the space feel inviting and respect the original warm wood tones of the architecture,’ Baker explains. Rooms are equipped with details that anticipate the island’s climate — freezers for drinks and ice cream, breathable linen fabrics, and natural ventilation through operable shutters. In the bathrooms, the material choices continue the tactile theme. ‘They feel very luxurious,’ she notes. ‘We added smoked terracotta floors and hand-applied neutral plaster walls. The vanities are made from hand-carved timber with intricate lattice designs, which pay homage to the island’s traditional baskets.’ Across all wellness areas — spanning a gym, yoga deck, steam room, sauna, and treatment huts — the finishes favor softness, durability, and quiet continuity with the architectural envelope.seventy works by twenty-one artists appear throughout the property  a curated balearic art collection The art collection at Soho Farmhouse Ibiza is curated by Soho House’s Chief Art Director, Kate Bryan, with a focus on artists living in or connected to the Balearic Islands. ‘Our mission was clear: to showcase a diverse range of artists all of whom have a connection to the island, whether born, based or trained in the Balearic Islands,’ she says. Seventy works by twenty-one artists appear throughout the property...",

Created in response to the festival’s theme, Birth, Destiny and What We Leave Behind, the installation explores spatial storytelling through material assembly, public interaction, and site-specific design. The structure is constructed from 500 locally sourced bamboo poles, hand-split into over 2,500 individual strands. These were woven over a ten-day period to form a curved, tunnel-like shell extending 40 metres in length and rising to over seven metres in height. The installation was developed in collaboration with the public, who contributed handwritten messages directly onto 8-metre-long bamboo strips. These inscriptions, totalling 25,000, were integrated into the structure, becoming both surface and narrative elements. Designed to allow full pedestrian passage, the tunnel widens and rises in height as one moves through it. The curvature is calculated to disrupt a direct line of sight, encouraging users to experience the structure as a sequence of changing spatial conditions. The tunnel’s entrance was positioned to frame a view toward the Sydney Opera House, while its arching form echoes that of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, establishing visual and material dialogue with the surrounding context.all images by Juan Pablo Pinto unless stated otherwise  Community members join Cave Urban in the making of the pavilion Material selection played a central role in the project’s design logic. Bamboo was chosen for its availability, tensile strength, flexibility, and ease of manual processing. Its curved form enabled the construction of a lightweight yet stable structural shell approximately 5 cm thick. The golden tone of the bamboo visually connects with the adjacent sandstone facade of the MCA, while its woven construction contrasts with the geometric rigidity of the museum’s architecture. The installation process involved collaboration between Cave Urban’s team and skilled practitioners, as well as untrained participants. The complexity of the structure required a responsive construction method in which community members contributed directly to the making. The site operated as a collective fabrication space, where material preparation and weaving took place simultaneously. This public involvement formed an integral part of the spatial and conceptual outcome. What We Leave Behind functions as a spatial record of participatory engagement, constructed with impermanence in mind. Its formal language and assembly process reflect themes of interconnection, accumulation, and collective authorship within a contemporary urban context.     image by Victor Frankowski image by Chloé Lindsay Dayeimage by Neil Bennettimage by Chloé Lindsay Dayeimage by Neil Bennettimage by Nergal U-Khan  1/9     image by Alexi Lookingstonimage by Alexi Lookingston image by Nici Longproject info: name: What We Leave Behind designer: Juan Pablo Pinto designer: Cave Urban | @caveurbanarea: 200 sqm dimensions: 40m (L) x 7m (W) x 4.5m (H)location: Museum of Contemporary Art Forecourt, Tallawoladah Lawn, Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia client: Sydney Festival lead designer: Juan Pablo Pinto design team: Nici Long, Jed Long, Mercurio Alvarado, Maeve Corke Butters, Erin Zikos, May Baker, Hamish Shorrocks, Taya Solomon, Honey Long, Prue Stent engineer: Event Engineering steel tie-down: Eveleigh Worksharvesting volunteers: Alexia Dermatis, Alfredo Santos Ramírez, Alicia Mardones, Angela Ha, Ashleigh Williams, Atheer Albokhari, Audrey See, Bethany Chamberlain, Célia Lesigne, Dena R...",

Positioned between the city’s Nikolaifleet canal and the broad avenue of Willy-Brandt-Strasse, the project responds to its layered context by referencing the city’s industrial heritage through a distinctly contemporary lens. Defined by its rhythmic pilasters and sculptural massing, the building mediates between the encompassing low-rise Fleet houses and the larger-scale developments. Across its elevations, semi-circular brick columns bring both visual weight and material texture, echoing the city’s 20th-century tradition of Brick Expressionism. With varied recesses and stepped rooflines, the building also reflects the irregular geometry of the site and subtly reinforces key urban axes leading toward the harbor and nearby square.all images © Simon Menges  the mixed-use complex wraps in local red brick Christ & Gantenbein’s project is distinguished by its attention to brick as both a structural and symbolic material. Locally sourced and hand-produced bricks by Rusch, the last surviving ring kiln brickyard in the region, bring both color and craft to the facade, while embedding regional memory into the contemporary architectural language.  The Swiss firm has also introduced green-painted window frames that offer a subtle contrast to the red bricks, introducing a contemporary palette to the historic texture. Elsewhere, the load-bearing structure — anchored by deep poles to accommodate the waterside setting — balances tectonic clarity with a sensitivity to site-specific conditions.Christ & Gantenbein completes mixed-use office and residential complex in central Hamburg  A dual program With varied recesses and stepped rooflines Designed to accommodate both office and residential programs, the development comprises two distinct volumes, with a taller corner element facing the bridge positioned with a more restrained canal-facing wing. While the office facade adopts a denser rhythm, the residential bays are wider, offering more privacy and sunlight. A restaurant and public spaces activate the ground floor, fostering connection between the canal and the adjacent square. Within, Christ & Gantenbein has organized the programs for flexibility. The office floors can be subdivided freely, benefitting from natural light on multiple sides, while residential units, oriented south over the water, benefit from a quieter aspect and open views. Two dedicated entrances — one for residents and one for workers — also reinforce the programmatic split and enhance legibility from the street.the project responds eferences the city’s industrial heritage through a distinctly contemporary lens a rhythmic facade of red clay bricksdefined by its rhythmic pilasters and sculptural massingthe firm introduces green-painted window frames that offer a subtle contrast to the red brickswith varied recesses and stepped rooflines, the building also reflects the irregular geometry of the sitethe load-bearing structure balances tectonic clarity with a sensitivity to site-specific conditions   1/8        project info: name: Willy Brandt Strasse mixed-use complexarchitect: Christ & Gantenbein | @christgantenbeinlocation: Hamburg, Germanyravail khan I designboom (339)jul 31, 2025KEEP UP WITH OUR DAILY AND WEEKLY NEWSLETTERS daily - see sample weekly - see sample READERS SHOP your own online design shop — no sales commission collected start sellingdirect businessno commissions architecture in germany (324) Jul 16, 2025interlocking volumes defin...",

They can play a game on the top screen while using the bottom one to check a guide, play music, or run a second game. Two applications can simultaneously work and be moved between screens with a swipe, and the second screen also shows the system information, like the CPU usage and battery level, as well as the controller settings. The main screen of the Ayaneo Pocket DS is seven inches in size. It uses OLED technology and has a 1080p resolution. The screen supports refresh rates up to 165 Hz, as well as HDR capabilities, and can automatically adjust to save battery. The second screen is smaller, five inches in size, and uses a 4:3 ratio LCD panel with a resolution of 1024×768. This screen is mainly for retro games and multitasking, but both screens can work together or separately. Because the device runs on Android, Ayaneo Pocket DS can open other apps besides games.all images courtesy of Ayaneo  turbofan and copper parts help cool down the flip-up device The retro-console inspiration revives the D-pad, ABXY buttons, joysticks, and triggers for the Android-run Ayaneo Pocket DS. The company says that the joysticks use electromagnetic sensors for higher accuracy and longer life and that the triggers support both linear and digital input. They design the buttons for fast response, and the system also includes vibration motors and built-in speakers for while the user is playing. The hinge allows the screen to open at any angle between 0 and 180 degrees, so there is no fixed position lock, and users can adjust the screen freely. The flip lid uses a magnetic and rubber system to close tightly. Specs-wise, the Ayaneo Pocket DS runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 platform.  It has eight CPU cores and uses the Adreno A32 GPU for graphics, and this setup allows for both Android and emulated PC games. The device includes different performance modes that users can switch between depending on the task, and to manage its heat, the device, equipped with an 8,000 mAh battery, has a PC-style cooling system, which includes a turbofan and copper components that help remove heat from the device. The body is also made of CNC-machined metal, which helps with heat flow and device durability. So far, the company is set to bring the Android-run device to ChinaJoy 2025 in Shanghai, China, starting on August 1, and the team has already opened the pool of pre-orders for the Ayaneo Pocket DS.Ayaneo unveils Pocket DS, a retro-inspired handheld gaming console that runs on Androidthe model is dubbed the first flip-up, dual-screen Android handheld devicethe installed software allows users to operate both screens at once, even when they’re for different purposesthe top screen is seven inches in size, while the bottom one is five inchesthe retro-console inspiration revives the D-pad, ABXY buttons, joysticks, and triggers he device has a PC-style cooling system, which includes a turbofan and copper parts project info: name: Pocket DScompany: Ayaneo | @ayaneoofficialmatthew burgos I designboom (1636)jul 30, 2025KEEP UP WITH OUR DAILY AND WEEKLY NEWSLETTERS daily - see sample weekly - see sample READERS SHOP your own online design shop — no sales commission collected start sellingdirect businessno commissions android (5) Sep 07, 2023bye, android! google gives logo a makeover with capital A and 3D robot th...",

The footprint of this project is anchored by a new public plaza that draws together three of the city’s most significant spatial axes: the park, the boulevard, and the square. The facade of New Boulevard Tower is built in cast-in-place concrete, using textures and pigments drawn from Tirana’s architectural palette. Throughout the building, wraparound balconies open each apartment to wide views over the city. The top three floors are designed as penthouses, oriented toward the future park.all visualizations by MIR   local context shapes New Boulevard Tower The project is led by Oppenheim Architecture’s Tirana studio, where a team of local architects and planners has been steadily contributing to Albania’s evolving built environment. New Boulevard Tower continues that trajectory with a material and spatial language shaped by local context. The building rises along Northern Boulevard, a newly developed spine that is central to Tirana’s ongoing shift toward more sustainable and pedestrian-centered planning. As part of a long-term city-wide strategy, over 65% of the redesigned urban core is being allocated to foot and cycle traffic. The role of the tower in this transition is less about visual dominance and more about how it connects different layers of urban life, tying public infrastructure to residential programs, and open space to vertical density.Oppenheim Architecture breaks ground on New Boulevard Tower  green roofs top the project At street level, the plaza provides a shared ground where public movement converges and overlaps, creating space for everyday use rather than formal programming. ‘This is one of many projects we are delivering in Albania,’ notes Beat Huesler, the firm’s Europe Director. ‘We’re working from our Tirana studio to support the city’s evolution through architecture that reflects place and community.’ The tower also incorporates environmental systems in line with Tirana’s broader ecological ambitions. These include green roofs, energy-efficient infrastructure, and passive design strategies. While relatively modest in appearance, such elements signal a shift in how private development is being aligned with public sustainability goals in the city.the 38-story residential building will stand among the tallest in Albaniawraparound balconies open each apartment to wide views over the citythe facade of New Boulevard Tower is built in cast-in-place concrete the footprint of this project is anchored by a new public plazaconnecting different layers of urban lifeusing textures and pigments drawn from Tirana’s architectural palette the plaza provides a shared ground where public movement converges and overlaps project info: name: New Boulevard Towerarchitect: Oppenheim Architecture | @oppenheimarchitecturelocation: Tirana, Albania visualizations: MIR | @mir.nothomai tsimpou I designboom (304)jul 30, 2025KEEP UP WITH OUR DAILY AND WEEKLY NEWSLETTERS daily - see sample weekly - see sample READERS SHOP your own online design shop — no sales commission collected start sellingdirect businessno commissions architecture in albania (40) Jul 24, 2025oppenheim architecture unveils all-red vlore beach tower as part of albania's coastal revival Jul 16, 2025studio libeskind & kontakt weave public gardens through curved residences in tirana Jul 09, 2025oppenheim architecture layers village-scale blocks and vibrant towers on albania's coast May 29, ...",

The rings, of different diameters, rest on top of each other in a delicate balance that suggests a stability as calculated as it is fragile. As they rotate, they change their appearance: what the eye perceives as a circle can become an ellipse, and vice versa, depending on the angle of view and the speed of rotation. Driven from its base by a mechanism that allows rotation in two directions, the installation unfolds a perpetual choreography: a continuous cycle that produces infinite patterns, in which the shapes collide visually and transform before the viewer’s eyes. In this process, figures that seemed stable become ambiguous, generating illusions that affect the audience’s perception.all images by Ruben PBescos  Cycles sculpture encourages reconsideration of time as form The constant rotation confuses the spatial reading of the rings and blurs the notions of rotation and depth. In Cycles, SpY uses movement and time as sculptural materials. These not only alter the perceived form but also directly affect understanding, causing a state of perceptual dislocation. The loss of spatial references prevents a stable image of the sculpture from being fixed, producing a sense of visual disorientation. Continuing his research into kinetic systems and geometries in motion, the artist explores perception and time as artistic tools, actively involving the audience in the experience of his works. Cycles invites us to rethink the sculptural form not as a finished object, but as a consequence of movement. It is a proposal that sculpts time and turns the gaze into an active, physical, and mental act.Cycles by SpY is a kinetic sculpture made of nine rotating steel rings each ring rotates on its axis at a unique speed, creating shifting compositions  project info: name: CYCLES artist: SpY | @spy__studiophotographer: Ruben PBescos | @rubenpb  designboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here. edited by: christina vergopoulou | designboomSpY urban artjul 30, 2025KEEP UP WITH OUR DAILY AND WEEKLY NEWSLETTERS daily - see sample weekly - see sample READERS SHOP your own online design shop — no sales commission collected start sellingdirect businessno commissions interactive installation (426) Jul 29, 2025two suspended white wings float around luminous central sphere for oas/s-nest installation Jul 29, 2025shaped like a sticky rice dumpling, cheng tsung feng’s bamboo cabin nestles in taiwan forest Jul 25, 2025fans' inscriptions cover nigel VMU's six-foot sculptural cup trophy replicas for FA cup final Jul 24, 2025zélé collective turns uber eats' entire menu into 22-meter-long print artwork Jul 22, 2025modular lighting installation by cheng tsung feng evokes vertical clustered plant colonies kinetic installations (32) Jun 30, 2025historic industrial chimney becomes roaming sculpture by team B/O in south korea Jun 27, 2025vincent leroy's kinetic installation of metallic mesh flowers floats above hainan island in china flowing UK river becomes engine for handcrafted kinetic installation by tom & matt May 31, 2025three kinetic generative sculptures express internal psychological states as digital poems May 09, 2025norman foster and porsche unveil glimmering kinetic gateway to venice's waterways sculpture (449) Jul 28, 2025didi NG wing yin carves sculptural pleats on wood to resemble soft and light fabric Jul 25, 20...",

The Ankara-based software engineer produces the open-source holder because he couldn’t find a suitable case for the Elora model by the keyboard kits and cases company splitkb.com. He chose this specific device, which follows the design of the Kyria model, because of the added number row, which is important for him since he often uses keyboard shortcuts like Command+1 and Command+2. The problem is that the split mechanical keyboard doesn’t come with a case, and the included wrist pads feel too light and not too durable for the engineer. Drawing from his experience working on design projects in the past, he decided to create a custom case for the device, making the shell more solid using 3D printing and having a chunkier set of wrist pads that are modular, so the owner has the option not to use them. The engineer describes that the resulting case for the split mechanical keyboard is somewhat similar to the Kinesis Advantage 360 Pro keyboard.all images courtesy of Fatih Arslan  The Kinesis leather wrist pads attach magnetically It took the software engineer Fatih Arslan several weeks to design and complete the open-source and 3D printable split mechanical keyboard case. He started with hand sketches, continued in Fusion 360, which is 3D CAD software, and tested different layouts to solve problems related to size, modularity, and cable access. The final design includes two main components: a bottom base and a top plate. These parts fit together to create a complete shell for each half of the split keyboard. Several versions of the top plate were developed, and this was necessary because the Halcyon Elora device supports different modular parts, such as a display, encoder, or touchpad.  Some users may choose to attach a wrist pad, while others may not, and each of these options changes the shape of the top cover. The engineer adds two USB-C ports on the left part of the case, while the right part has one. The design includes space and holes for cable routing, which was a major design challenge. USB-C ports on DIY keyboards can be in different locations, so the case design had to allow for flexible placement. The split mechanical keyboard case supports Kinesis leather wrist pads, which attach magnetically. To fit this, four 10mm x 3mm magnet holes are placed in the bottom base of the case, and there are also versions of the top plate that skip wrist pad support if users prefer a cleaner look or different typing position.view of the Halcyon Elora with case  rubber stoppers under the base of the accessory Users can add rubber stoppers (9mm x 2mm) under the base of the case to prevent the split mechanical keyboard from sliding. The bottom also includes a cutout hole, which makes it easier to remove the typing tool from the shell if it needs to be modified or fixed, and the design introduces a five-degree positive tilt for the keyboard. This means the back of each half is raised slightly, and the tilt is intended to improve comfort without adding too much height or size to the keyboard. It is designed to be a subtle change that doesn’t affect portability. The case provides full top and bottom coverage and a more solid structure. Without the case, the Elora is exposed and light, and with it, it looks more like a finished product rather than a custom one. The engineer has published the case files for free on his website, including links to Makerworld, where all 12 top plate files can be downloaded separately. It allows users to select only the parts they need and make their own 3D print...",

Acland Burghley School in Tufnell Park, north London, will soon host the UK’s first museum dedicated to Brutalist architecture. Backed by a grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, the renovation will be led by Reed Watts Architects who will restore the school’s Grade II-listed Assembly Hall, transforming it into a multifunctional public venue that combines performance space, exhibition facilities, and a permanent museum collection.  Designed in 1968 by Howell, Killick, Partridge & Amis — the only school project by the renowned post-war architects — Acland Burghley’s hall was originally conceived as a community anchor. With its distinctive hexagonal form and double-ended auditorium, the space was built to house everything from lectures and school assemblies to opera and boxing matches. Despite decades of wear and some unfortunate interventions, the raw concrete structure has remained a cherished example of socially driven modernist design.Acland Burghley school, Tufnell Park | image by Jim Osley via Wikimedia Commons  reed watts architects’ to restore original brutalist structure The upcoming project led by Reed Watts Architects will repair damaged fabric, restore original architectural features, and improve access within the listed structure. The London-based practice first announced their involvement and titled their proposal Hall for All, approaching the project with a focus on the Assembly Hall at the heart of the school. They noted its distinct geometry, as well as its symbolic presence reflecting the ideals of the school’s broader 1960s Brutalist architecture conceived in an era of social progress. Quoting the original headmaster’s sentiment, they noted that the hall’s completion was the pivotal anchor to the school’s community. Once completed, it will thus feature several initiatives all aimed at reinstating the hall’s civic function by forming a local cultural engine. Alongside this restoration move that will preserve a part of London’s Brutalist heritage, it will give a physical home to the UK’s first Museum of Brutalist Architecture which is currently operating only online. It will feature permanent and rotating exhibitions, digital archives, and community programming. Plans also include cross-generational events, screenings, and collaborations with residents, students, and arts groups, all aimed at reinstating the Assembly Hall’s civic function. Consultation with the school, families, and local stakeholders has underpinned the project from the outset, ensuring that the building’s next chapter remains tied to its founding ethos centered on architecture as a tool for collective learning and expression.stairwell tower in Acland Burghley School | image by Robert Lamb via Wikimedia Commonsroof in the quad area of Acland Burghley School | image by Robert Lamb via Wikimedia Commonsimage courtesy of Reed Watts Architectsimage courtesy of Reed Watts Architectsrestoration of the school’s Grade II-listed Assembly Hall | image courtesy of Reed Watts Architects UK’s first museum dedicated to Brutalist architecture | image courtesy of Reed Watts Architectsthe school will be transformed into a multifunctional public venue | image courtesy of Reed Watts Architectsplans to repair damaged fabric, restore original features, and improve access | image courtesy of Reed Watts Architects  project info: name: Museum of Brutalist Architecturearchitect: Reed Watts Architects | @reedwattsarch location: Acland Burghley Sch...",

Each zone draws on landscape elements and natural materials to support a wide range of experiences. In the All-Age Boulder Playground, massive boulders are arranged over a sandpit to form climbing, sliding, and sitting structures. These rocky features, whether real or digitally fabricated, form the framework for swings, trampolines, seesaws, climbing tunnels, and talking tubes. The adjacent Forest Garden combines native vegetation with winding paths and natural play installations, where children interact with the environment, developing both motor skills and cognitive awareness of balance, rhythm, and spatial orientation. To the west, the Water Garden extends this approach into aquatic play with a network of shallow creeks and spring-fed features, some fed by hand pumps and water-pressure devices, offering a sensory-rich environment where children and adults can engage with jumping fountains, water turntables, and winding channels.XISUI Design completes Boulder Park, a playground that spans 4,000 square meters  irregular structures integrate slides, tunnels and more What distinguishes Boulder Park architecturally is its use of 3D concrete printing as both a technological tool and a formal language. Developed in collaboration with 3D construction printing solutions company Guanli Intelligent Technology Co., the park’s large-scale installations, such as the cave-like climbing structures, are fabricated through additive robotic printing, allowing for the production of monolithic, complex forms directly from digital models. Unlike conventional construction, which relies on labor-intensive formwork and segmented assembly, this technique builds structures layer by layer with continuous material extrusion. The rounded and organically irregular resulting geometries mimic natural geological formations while integrating slides, handrails, tunnels, and steps into the continuous concrete skin.centering on the figure of the boulder as a recurring spatial motif  Structural Innovation with Human-Centered Outdoor Design XISUI Design emphasizes that landscape projects, unlike buildings, often have lighter structural demands and smaller scales, making them an ideal testing ground for emergent fabrication methods. ‘Compared to architecture, landscape structures have more diverse application scenarios,’ explains lead designer Hu Yihao. Despite current challenges in 3D-printed concrete, such as reinforcing techniques and uneven load distribution, the team reports achieving a material strength of 50 MPa, surpassing China’s standard for structural concrete (C40).

M+ Museum unveils HK:PM, a new moving image commission by Greg Girard, transforming its iconic LED facade along the bay into a visual journey through the city’s transformation from the 1970s to the 1990s. Animated from Girard’s extensive personal archive of analogue photographs, the series weaves together street scenes from Central, neon-lit avenues, moments of daily life, and images from the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City — capturing the at once intimate and electric character of Hong Kong. Presented as a continuous loop, the sequence is presented like a silent film, shifting from imagery of students and street workers, nightclubs and celebrities, to soaring planes near Kai Tak, and the hum of activity along Victoria Harbour. Together they give renewed motion and meaning to fragments of memory of the metropolis through the Canadian photographer’s cinematic lens.all images courtesy of Greg Girard | image by M+ Museum  a cinematic visual journey through the metropolis in the 70s-90s Greg Girard has long been recognized for his capacity to document cities in flux. In HK:PM, his images return to their place of origin, animated at a monumental scale on the south-facing LED facade of M+ Museum. Through the interplay of movement and stillness, these photographs evolve into a visual narrative about a city’s collective identity. ‘When I first took the bulk of these images as a young photographer in the 1970s, I never imagined them resonating with an audience, let alone shown to an entire city,’ the photographer writes.‘Creating HK:PM has been a journey of rediscovery… transforming fragments of Hong Kong’s recent past into a cinematic sequence.’ This act of returning, of images taken in Hong Kong now projected back onto its skyline, gives the work an added resonance, and the incidental becomes iconic. The work is especially poignant as Girard’s practice often sits at the intersection of personal memory and urban transformation, looking at the transformation of various metropolitan cities across Asia. From the Kowloon Walled City to Phantom Shanghai, his archives document architectural disappearance with emotional clarity.image by M+ Museum  m+ museum reclaims urban memory through a sequence of images Curated by Silke Schmickl, Head of Moving Image at M+, HK:PM builds on the museum’s 2024 programme Hong Kong Made Me, an earlier collaboration with Greg Girard that transformed his photographs into a live cinema event scored by rock duo Gong Gong Gong. In this new chapter, the images are given a luminous stage to speak for themselves. Spanning over 65,000 square meters, M+ is among the most significant institutions for contemporary visual culture in Asia, and its LED facade — one of the largest media screens in the world — has become a key platform for engaging the public through digital commissions. Overlooking Victoria Harbour, it functions as a civic media space and artistic landmark, transforming moving image into urban spectacle.looping along Victoria Harbour’s waterfront | image by M+ Museum image by M+ MuseumGreg Girard presents HK:PManimated from Girard’s analogue photographic archives, the series captures the electric character of Hong KongHong Kong’s skyline is lighting up nightly with a tribute to its own pastthe sequence is presented like a silent film, shifting from imagery of students and street workers to nightclubs and celebritiesfeaturing images of the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City a vibrant metropolis in flux project info: name: HK:PMphotographer: Greg Girardlocation: M+ Museum, Hong Kong | @mplusmuseumravail khan I designb...",

Danielle Wood on Future of Space Exploration In this wide-ranging conversation, MIT Media Lab professor Danielle Wood reflects on the evolving role of NASA, the importance of scientific expertise, and the growing synergy between government and private space efforts. Wood underscores the decades-long investment it takes to build NASA’s scientific leadership—and why retaining experienced talent and nurturing future innovators is crucial to maintaining US competitiveness in space and Earth science.She highlights the complementary relationship between public research infrastructure and private-sector innovation, noting that today's most creative advancements often emerge from this intersection. Technology, she explains, “always matures from the lab into use,” and today’s collaborations between NASA and private industry are accelerating that process.Speaking from her experience at MIT, Wood shares the sense of hope she gains from her students:\"They give me hope every day. They have high standards about what the future looks like. They believe in a more equitable society. They want to protect the planet. They want to make sure that things we invest our time in are good for today and good for the long term. They see a need to collaborate across different boundaries.\"Looking ahead, Wood sees a new, globally inclusive era of space exploration. With rising space agencies on every continent—including a newly launched African Space Agency—she believes the world is entering an exciting new chapter where space technology can advance science, sustainability, and shared prosperity for all.

Karahalios will join the faculty as Full Professor of Media Arts and Sciences, effective September 1, 2025. A pioneering researcher in algorithmic awareness and auditing, and human-centered computing, Dr. Karahalios returns to MIT—where she earned SB and ME degrees in the EECS Department and completed her SM and PhD in Media Arts and Sciences in 2004—with a celebrated body of work that bridges technical innovation, deep social responsibility, and high-level leadership that has led to significant real-world impact.Most recently, Dr. Karahalios served as a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with affiliate appointments in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, School of Information Sciences, and the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory. She is also the co-founder and co-director of the Center for Just Infrastructures , a cross-disciplinary initiative focused on designing inclusive, community-informed technologies.Karrie Karahalios is a pioneer in the exploration of social media and of how people communicate in environments that are increasingly mediated by algorithms, which, as she has written, “shape the world around us.” Her work combines computing, systems, AI, anthropology, sociology, psychology, game theory, design, and infrastructure studies. The communication infrastructures she studies range from social networks, to online health management systems, to collective compendiums such as Reddit, to many more contexts. Her goal has been to uncover the function and preconditions of guiding algorithms, to inform the public about their behaviors and limitations, and to use this knowledge to  create new infrastructures that are – as she says – “productive, accountable and safe.” She is widely recognized for co-developing the concept of Algorithmic Audits, a framework now standard for uncovering discrimination and bias in opaque digital systems. In 2016, she was a plaintiff in an important ACLU lawsuit challenging the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), advocating for researchers’ rights to investigate algorithms that affect housing, employment, and access. It is widely considered that this lawsuit, largely supported  by Karahalios’ work, changed the definition of ‘hacking’ in the U.S., strengthening civil liberties and civil rights enforcement.Dr. Karahalios’s work has received numerous honors, including the NSF CAREER Award, Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, SIGMOD Best Paper Award, and recognition as an ACM Distinguished Member. She currently chairs the CSCW Steering Committee, and her research has received top honors at CHI, CSCW, and SIGMOD.The Media Lab helped shape my research voice. It’s where I first learned to ask not only what technology can do, but what it should do.“The Media Lab helped shape my research voice. It’s where I first learned to ask not only what technology can do, but what it should do,\" states Karrie Karahalios. “I’m excited to collaborate with this extraordinary community to reimagine systems that serve people—especially those too often excluded from tech design.”At the Media Lab, Prof. Karahalios will expand on her current research into the impact of human agency and community when using AI systems. This will include designing \"contestable systems\" where people can participate in human-AI dialogue with a system and with governing bodies (such as City Councils) in the context of city governance. In addition, she will work towards reconciling computer science, AI, and the law. She will also investigate improvements in online governance  through establishing rule alignment between governing bodies (like platform moderators) and the general public. She has already started collaboration discussions with colleagues in many different Media Lab groups and throughout MIT SCC, IDSS, EECS, Sloan, DUSP, and well beyond.

This enables greater stability and gives the user much more control over the movement of the prosthesis.Participants in a small clinical study also reported that the limb felt more like a part of their own body, compared to people who had more traditional above-the-knee amputations.“A prosthesis that's tissue-integrated — anchored to the bone and directly controlled by the nervous system — is not merely a lifeless, separate device, but rather a system that is carefully integrated into human physiology, offering a greater level of prosthetic embodiment. It’s not simply a tool that the human employs, but rather an integral part of self,” says Hugh Herr, a professor of media arts and sciences, co-director of the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics at MIT, an associate member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the new study.Tony Shu PhD ’24 is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Science.

Vercoe Former Professor Emeritus; Former Founder Projects Audio Spotlight Context-Aware Playlist Generation Embedded Audio Systems Generative Music Systems Groups Program in Media Arts and Sciences Media Lab Research Theme: Cultivating Creativity Share this post Visionary Computer Music Pioneer, Composer, and Founding Faculty Member of the MIT Media Lab Personal reflections View media Barry Vercoe at the MIT Media Lab Barry Vercoe, a pioneering force in computer music and a founding faculty member of the MIT Media Lab, passed away on June 15, 2025. Born in Wellington, New Zealand (July 24, 1937), his life was a rich symphony of artistry, science, and innovation that led to profound enhancements of musical experience for expert musicians as well as for the general public—and especially young people.Vercoe earned dual bachelor’s degrees in music (1959) and mathematics (1962) from the University of Auckland, followed by an A.Mus.D. in music composition from the University of Michigan in 1968.After completing postdoctoral research in digital audio processing at Princeton and a visiting lectureship at Yale, Vercoe joined MIT’s Department of Humanities (Music) in 1971, beginning a tenure in the department that lasted through 1984. During this period, he played a key role in advancing what would become MIT’s Music & Theater Arts (MTA) section, helping to shape its forward-thinking curriculum and interdisciplinary philosophy. Vercoe championed the integration of musical creativity with scientific inquiry, laying the groundwork for MTA’s enduring emphasis on music technology and experimental composition.In 1973, Vercoe founded MIT’s Experimental Music Studio (EMS)—the Institute’s first dedicated computer music facility and one of the first in the world. Operated under the auspices of the music program, EMS became a crucible for innovation in algorithmic composition, digital synthesis, and computer-assisted performance. His leadership not only positioned MIT as a hub for music technology, but also influenced how the Institute approached the intersection of the arts with engineering. This legacy is honored today by a commemorative plaque in the Kendall Square MBTA station. Violist, faculty founder of the MIT Chamber Music Society, and Institute Professor Marcus Thompson says: “Barry was first and foremost a fine musician, and composer for traditional instruments and ensembles.\"As a young professor he taught our MIT undergraduates to write and sing Renaissance counterpoint as he envisioned how the act of traditional music making offered a guide to potential artistic interaction between humans and computers. \"In 1976 he enlisted me to premiere what became his iconic, and my most performed work, ‘Synapse for viola and computer.’”  During a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982–83, Vercoe developed the Synthetic Performer, a groundbreaking real-time interactive accompaniment system, while working closely with flautist Larry Beauregard at IRCAM in Paris.In 1984, Vercoe became a founding faculty member of the MIT Media Lab, where he launched the Music, Mind, and Machine group. His research spanned machine listening, music cognition, and real-time digital audio synthesis. His Csound language, created in 1985, is still widely used for music programming, and his contributions helped define the MPEG-4 Structured Audio standard.He also served as Associate Academic Head of the Media Lab’s graduate program in Media Arts and Sciences (MAS). Vercoe mentored many future leaders in digital music and sound computation, including two of his MAS graduate students–Anna Huang (S.M. ‘08) and Paris Smaragdis (Ph.D. ‘01)–who have recently joined MIT’s music faculty, and Miller Puckette (Emeritus Faculty, UC San Diego) and Richard Boulanger (Professor, Electronic Production and Design, Berklee College of Music).“Barry Vercoe will be remembered by designers, developers, researchers, and composers\tfor his greatest ‘composition,’ Csound, his free and open source software synthesis language,\"\tstates Boulanger. “I know that through Csound…..”Barry's musical spirit will live on, not only in my teaching, my research, and my music, but in the apps, plugins, and musical compositions ...",

The research highlights how overusing AI tools like ChatGPT may impact how we think—and why human effort still matters. Nataliya Kosmyna on CNN: How AI use may weaken brain activity Omar Jimenez, on The Brief with Jim Sciutto TranscriptOMAR JIMENEZ:  Meanwhile, a new study from MIT is raising the alarm about how A.I. impacts learning and how convenience could come at a cost for your brain. The study looked at essay writing across three groups, people using AI, a search engine, or just their own brain power. That last group, no tools at all, showed the strongest brain activity plus better memory recall. They were followed by the search engine users and in last place, people relying on AI.Now, as students and workers become more and more dependent on tools like ChatGPT, it does raise a lot of questions about the future of how we think.Joining me now is Nataliya Kosmyna lead author on the study. Thank you for being here. Can you just explain what you learned from this study? Did it surprise you?NATALIYA KOSMYNA, LEAD STUDY AUTHOR AND RESEARCH SCIENTIST, MIT: Yes, absolutely. So grateful to be here with you. Thank you also for the summarization, that was great, but very important details that you missed, which is actually super interesting is additional session we performed with those participants.We actually reassigned them in the very end, towards the final session. So, if you were, Omar, my participant, and you had done LLM group for three sessions, for the final session, I actually assign you to the brain only group, or opposite, if you are only writing your essays with your brain, so brain, brain, brain, with your final session, I actually would reassign you to LLM group.And so, what happens there is very interesting. Those folks who were LLM, LLM, LLM, and then use their brain to write an essay actually showed weaker neural connectivity compared to brain only folks. And those who first use the brain, so, brain, brain, brain, then you use LLM, actually showed high neural connectivity.Among other things that we learned about ownership of essays, did they consider those essays their own? What actually neural connectivity means is, in layman terms, like you have right now me. If I would—were in the room right now next to you and we had your producer next to us, your producer would talk to you, I would—then you would talk to me. I would tell you something back. So, we actually see who talks to who in the brain and how much talking is happening. That's what we learned.I appreciate that you didn't say brain rot, stupid, dumb because we saw a lot of those. So, please, please, please do not use this vocabulary. So, thank you so much. Really important that its impact.

Future You Pat Pataranutaporn, Pattie Maes, Kavin Winson, and Thanawit (Tae) Prasongpongchai have been selected as honorees in the Academic Excellence category.From Fast Company:A team including researchers from MIT, KBTG, UCLA, and Harvard has developed an AI-powered digital twin that serves as a model of users' future selves. The tool has so far reached over 52,000 users across more than 190 countries, giving people the opportunity to discuss their aspirations and potential futures with an AI version of themselves. Research so far has indicated that the AI system reduces people's anxiety and helps them feel more connected to their future selves, which can lead to better long-term planning, health, and academic performance. Since the system relies on AI interaction rather than human role-playing, it's set up for scalability, and researchers have tested its applicability to group therapy sessions at Harvard Medical School. BuzzCamPatrick Chwalek and Marie Kuronaga have been selected as honorees in the Technology Solutions category. From Fast Company:The BuzzCam is a noninvasive ecological monitoring device that can identify bee species by their distinctive buzzes without disturbing the insects or their habitats. That, in turn, can help scientists and farmers understand what's happening with important pollinator species in particular areas. In March 2024, the BuzzCam team deployed nine of the devices in Argentina and Chile, capturing buzz recordings of two bee species as field workers noted simultaneous observations with a custom iOS app. The data has been published and made open source—and used to develop new machine learning systems to classify bee buzzes with high accuracy. The team plans to deploy the system in Patagonia and beyond to collect new information about the presence of various bee species.
