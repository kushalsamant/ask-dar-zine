    "content": "<p>Park1538 is a public space embedded within the everyday landscape of Gwangyang, an industrial city known for its steel production. The project was inspired by the name \"Gwangyang\" itself—'Gwang' meaning light and 'Yang' sunlight—which became a guiding principle in shaping the form and spirit of the space. The resulting architecture captures the flowing rhythm of light through its curved steel surfaces, creating a sculptural yet purposeful structure that embodies both technological and cultural narratives.</p>",
